I am a PhD candidate in the Department of [Statistics and Data Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html) in [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Kathryn Roeder](https://kathrynmroeder.github.io). While she is my primary thesis advisor, I also collaborate extensively with Professors [Tianyu Zhang](https://terrytianyuzhang.github.io) and [Yuting Wei](https://yutingwei.github.io) on a variety of projects, many of which are joint efforts with Professor Roeder. We worked on developing and applying machine learning methods on high dimensional, nonparamatric data, particularly in settings with strong dependencies. I have also extensively worked with Professor [Weijing Tang](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/weijingtang/home) on statistical network inference. Before coming to CMU, I obatined a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [University of Science and technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn) in 2019.


## Research Interests

I'm interested in developing and applying machine learning methodologies on real-data applications including:

-   **Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis** (both novel scientific questions and methodological developments)
-   **Generative Models and Synthetic Data Analysis** (especially the diffusion model and data debiasing)
-   **Statistical Network Inference**

## Publications

- **Ergan Shang**, Yuting Wei, Kathryn Roeder, "Predicting the unseen: a diffusion-based debiasing framework for transcriptional response prediction at single-cell resolution"

## Working Papers

- **Ergan Shang**, Tianyu Zhang and Kathryn Roeder, "XConTest: A Perturbation Effect Convergence Analysis that Deciphers Gene Function Similarity"
- **Ergan Shang**, Weijing Tang and Yuan Zhang, "Inference for Balance Theory in Time-Varying Signed Network"

## Software

### HMC. [Github](https://github.com/terrytianyuzhang/HMC). [R CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HMC/index.html). [Tutorial](https://terrytianyuzhang.github.io/HMC/HMC_tutorial.html) (co-developed with Tianyu Zhang):

Tianyu Zhang, Jing Lei, and Kathryn Roeder. "Debiased Projected Two-Sample Comparisonscfor Single-Cell Expression Data."

## News
- **2025.06.** I presented a poster titled "Inference for Balance Theory in Time-Varying Signed Network" in the [2025 Workshop on Statistical Network Analysis and Beyond (SNAB 2025)](https://yangfengstat.github.io/snab2025/) in Tokyo, Japan.
- **2025.04.** I am honored to receive the **Mihaela Serban Award** for the Best Student Poster in the American Statistical Association(ASA) Banquet in Pittsburgh.
- **2024.08.** I gave a talk at [2024 Joint Statistical Meeting](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2024/) in the topic "Genetic Convergence Analysis of CRISPR Perturbations".

## Life and Hobby

I’m a big fan of Japanese culture, JPOP, and both anime and animation. I’ve been learning Japanese on my own for more than two years so that I can sing Japanese songs and sometimes watch Japanese TV series without subtitles. My favorite animation character is [Usagi](/erganshang/files/usagi.jpg) in *Chiikawa*, and my favorite animation is *Evangelion*. Here is a photo of my collections of [souvenirs](/erganshang/files/evangelion_family_photo.JPG) of Evangelion.
